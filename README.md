# Tick-Tack-Toe
Working Tick Tack Toe Game with Scoreboard.  -- Still need to add Computer Player


This is a working Tick-Tack-Toe game!!  The program is a 2-player game, it gives output of which users turn it is, in addition to a working scoreboard that keeps tracks of each players wins.  The scoreboard can be reset so no 'page-refresh' is nessesary.

the game is styled well, and even has a fun Super Mario Bro's Theme song playing when it is open (it can be paused).

Enjoy!!

**Eventually I will add a Computer AI player to it with an option for a single player game and a 2-player game.**
